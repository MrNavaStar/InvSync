# InvSync

This is a fabric mod for 1.16.x and 1.17.x that Allows you to sync player inventories, health, food level, experience and score across multiple servers! This is accomplished using an sqlite database (that is automatically generated and set up for you). Most mods should have no problem running along side, and modded items will also be sync'd.

## Requirements

- This mod requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) 
- You can get the mod on [Modrith](https://modrinth.com/mod/invsync) or on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invsync-fabric)

## Getting Started

Setup is very simple. Drop the mod into your mods folder on all the servers you want to sync. Starting a server will generate a config. The mod will not run until you edit the config.

## IMPORTANT NOTES 

- Configs MUST be identical between all participating servers in order for the mod to function correctly.

## Issues And Requests

If you find any bugs or glitches, be sure to make a bug report under issues and I will do my best to fix it! Just as well if you have a cool idea for something that I should add, let me know and I will consider adding it!
